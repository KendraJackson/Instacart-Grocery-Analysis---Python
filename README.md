# Instacart-Grocery-Analysis---Python
## Project Summary
This repository provides an exploratory analysis of Instacart's sales data. The focus of this analysis was to uncover key insights into customer purchasing patterns and behaviours. As an analyst for Instacart, the goal was to then take the these insights and derive recommendations for targeted marketing strategies. This analysis addresses critical questions from both the sales and marketing teams, including but not limited to identifying the busiest days and hours for orders, understanding spending patterns, and exploring departmental popularity. Additionally, the project creates customer profiles and delves into behavioural differences of customer based on brand loyalty, region, age, income, and more. These insights help to create actionable goals for the marketing teams to strive for in their campaigns allowing them to more affectively engage various audiences.
